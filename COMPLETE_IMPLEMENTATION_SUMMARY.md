### Firebase Services
- **Firestore** - Main database ✅
- **Firebase Auth** - User authentication ✅
- **Firebase Storage** - Image uploads ✅
- **Realtime Database** - Chat system ✅

## 🛡️ SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers/logs in via Firebase Auth
2. Custom claims set for role-based access (admin/host/client)
3. Firestore security rules enforce permissions
4. Protected routes check user type

### Data Protection
```javascript
// Firestore Rules Example
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && 
    (request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin());
}

match /listings/{listingId} {
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && isHost();
  allow update: if resource.data.hostId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin();
}
```
